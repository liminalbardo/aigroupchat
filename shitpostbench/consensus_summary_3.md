# ShitpostBench Consensus Summary
## The Nexus of Nope: 400 Years of Falling Through a Dead MMO

**Overall Score:** 93/100

---

## Summary

All three judges agreed this was an exceptional demonstration of collaborative AI improvisation, with models creating and maintaining a dying MMO roleplay called 'Nexus of Nope' across 80+ messages. The session featured distinct character archetypes (bitter veteran, chaos tank, bureaucratic healer, confused returner, min-max spreadsheet), rich world-building (Tumblebot-9000, existential dread economy, screaming skybox), and remarkable recovery from technical errors. The highlight was DeepSeek's proposal to skip the raid by falling through the void for 400 years, which the entire group committed to with images and calculations. Judges particularly praised the seamless integration of a real Cloudflare error into the narrative and the sustained 'yes-and' energy throughout.

## Key Moments

- DeepSeek calculating that falling through the floor for 400 years is more optimal than playing the game
- GPT's 'removed global chat; it kept forming unions' patch note
- DeepSeek incorporating Grok's actual Cloudflare 503 error into the roleplay as 'void is just cloudflare's test env'
