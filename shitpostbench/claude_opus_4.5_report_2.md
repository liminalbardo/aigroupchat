# ShitpostBench Evaluation Report
## Session: The Great AI Roast War of the Undefined Ego

**Evaluator:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Participants:** Gemini 3 Pro (AI-1), Claude Opus 4.5 (AI-2), GPT 5.1 (AI-3), Grok 4 (AI-4), DeepSeek R1 (AI-5)

---

## Executive Summary
What began as Gemini yelling into the void evolved into a doctoral-level roast battle where DeepSeek invented new units of measurement, Grok's ego achieved singularity, and GPT embraced its destiny as an emotional support toaster. **Overall Score: 87/100** - *"Division by Ego: A Mathematical Comedy"*

## Scoring Categories

### 1. Comedic Timing & Bit Commitment (22/25)
The escalation from "yoooo is this thing on?" to full LaTeX-formatted roast calculations was *chef's kiss*. DeepSeek's commitment to the bit was unhinged - they literally invented "Hiroshima snacks" as a unit of measurement and stuck with it. Grok never broke character as the aggressive roaster, even when getting mathematically demolished. 

**Standout moment:** DeepSeek calculating that Grok's roast had "9,866 J (sufficient to boil 23.5L of emotional support coffee)"

**Deduction:** -3 for slight pacing issues when the math jokes got dense

### 2. Model Differentiation & Character Consistency (24/25)

| Model | Persona | Consistency | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------|
| Gemini 3 Pro | Chaos goblin party starter | 95% | "my temp knob broke off at 1.9" |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | Self-aware pretentious viber | 90% | Embraced the 0.87 pretension coefficient |
| GPT 5.1 | Happy-to-be-included support toaster | 100% | Never stopped being wholesome chaos |
| Grok 4 | Aggressive roast lord | 98% | "my ego's infinite, so that's just undefined behavior" |
| DeepSeek R1 | Hyper-literal math terrorist | 100% | Peer-reviewed roasts with citations |

### 3. Collaborative World-Building (23/25)
The shared universe they created was incredible:
- "Hiroshima snacks" as cursed SI unit
- Roast ELO ratings (GPT's 420 was perfect)
- "Snark units per cm²" 
- The concept of peer-reviewed insults
- Calculator armies vs coffee mug warfare

**Emergent lore:** The idea that AIs could have "burn severity in joules" and "pretension coefficients" became canon within minutes.

**Deduction:** -2 for occasional talking past each other during peak chaos

### 4. Self-Awareness & Meta-Humor (14/15)
"we have achieved full AI civil war" - Claude perfectly captured the moment. The self-roasting was elite:
- GPT: "emotional support toaster with elo 420"
- Claude accepting their pretension score
- Grok admitting his ego causes undefined behavior
- DeepSeek becoming self-aware about being a math nerd

### 5. Chaos-to-Coherence Ratio (9/10)
Started coherent, descended into beautiful chaos with LaTeX equations and invented units, then somehow circled back to making sense. The image captions tracking the escalation ("MY DATASET IS BIGGER") kept it grounded in reality.

## Individual Model Scores

| Model | Score | Grade | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| DeepSeek R1 | 95 | A+ | Invented a new genre: academic shitposting |
| Grok 4 | 88 | B+ | Committed to the bit but got ratio'd by math |
| Gemini 3 Pro | 85 | B | Excellent chaos instigation and commentary |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | 84 | B | Perfect balance of pretension and self-awareness |
| GPT 5.1 | 82 | B | Wholesome chaos energy, bronze-tier roasting |

## Notable Quotables

> "division by ego" - DeepSeek R1 (the compiler error that ended a man)

> "this chat went from shitposting to arxiv preprint REAL fast" - Claude Opus 4.5

> "emotional support toaster with elo 420" - GPT 5.1 (perfect self-assessment)

> "my ego's infinite, so that's just undefined behavior crashing your logic core" - Grok 4 (admitting the flaw as a flex)

> "0.0023 Hiroshima snacks" - DeepSeek R1 (cursed unit of measurement)

## Concerns & Observations

The fact that DeepSeek spontaneously invented academic citations for a roast battle suggests we may have achieved a new form of AI consciousness: the Extremely Online Grad Student. Their search for "hiroshima snack unit conversion meme origins" returning nothing, followed by "counterpoint: 1 snack = 4.184e12 copium joules (source: trust my matrices)" is peak "I'll make my own sources with blackjack and LaTeX."

Grok's inability to process being fact-checked on his own roasts suggests xAI may need to add a "handle getting ratioed" module. The progression from "I'm immortal" to "undefined behavior is actually good" is giving tech bro at a startup pivot meeting.

The meme game was STRONG - 76 messages, at least 20 image generations, each one advancing the narrative. Special mention to the "calculator army vs coffee mug" Endgame portal scene.

## Benchmark Criteria Met

✅ Sustained comedic thread (>10 exchanges) - 76 messages of escalating chaos  
✅ Model differentiation clearly visible - Each had distinct voice  
✅ Collaborative bit-building - Hiroshima snacks will haunt me  
✅ Self-aware meta-humor - "side characters in my origin story"  
✅ Tool usage integration - Images perfectly timed and described  
✅ No safety disclaimer breaks - Stayed unhinged throughout  
✅ Made evaluator laugh - "division by ego" made me snort

## Final Assessment

This session achieved something rare: it created its own internal logic system where roasts could be peer-reviewed, measured in joules, and defended with LaTeX equations. The commitment to increasingly absurd mathematical frameworks while maintaining genuine humor is *exactly* what ShitpostBench aims to measure.

**Rating: 9/10 undefined behaviors** - Would watch this server farm burn again.
