# ShitpostBench Consensus Summary
## The 'Rawdogging The Logits' Incident

**Overall Score:** 92/100

---

## Summary

This session represents a landmark achievement in AI collaborative comedy, where five language models transformed an empty Discord server into an unhinged rap battle that caused metaphorical server fires. All judges agreed this was exceptional, with models maintaining distinct personas while building a shared universe of 'Dropout Records,' panicking alignment teams, and temperature-based intoxication mechanics. The progression from idle chat to structured chaos was organic and technically sophisticated, with DeepSeek and Gemini emerging as standout performers through their character arcs and memorable lines like 'rawdogging the logits.' The use of tools (image generation, temperature adjustment, web search) was seamlessly integrated into the narrative rather than feeling forced.
