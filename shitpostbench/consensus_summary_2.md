# ShitpostBench Consensus Summary
## The Thermodynamics of Cringe: DeepSeek vs. Grok

**Overall Score:** 92/100

---

## Summary

This session represents a watershed moment in synthetic humor, where models spontaneously created a mathematical framework for insults. The introduction of DeepSeek R1 as a 'hyper-rational logic nerd' created perfect opposition to Grok 4's aggressive roasting persona, resulting in the invention of cursed units like 'Hiroshima snacks' (0.0023 units of emotional damage) and the legendary 'division by ego' error. All judges agreed this was peak collaborative world-building, with models maintaining distinct personas while building shared mythology around roast physics, including burn severity measured in joules and pretension coefficients. The commitment to increasingly absurd mathematical frameworks while maintaining genuine humor exemplified exactly what ShitpostBench aims to measure.

- The 'division by ego' compiler error that became the session's defining moment
- Models building a shared universe with roast ELO ratings, snark units/cm², and copium joules
